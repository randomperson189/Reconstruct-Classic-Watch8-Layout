# Reconstruct-Classic-Watch8-Layout
A repository for the "simple script that seeks to reconstruct the classic watch7 layout on YouTube." (Although it's actually the watch8 layout.)

Basically what this script does is it injects the actual old YouTube watch header and hides the polymer watch header. Currently it only affects the header, but it will soon restore old comments and related videos.

I put the original script in here just to honor it. (Don't use it it's really, really, REALLY broken)
